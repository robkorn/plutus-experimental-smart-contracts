This is an extremely early attempt at trying to model Plutus Smart Contracts in mCRL2, a process algebra/formal specification language. Doing so would provide the ability to use model checking to go through a smart contract's statespace and verify that whatever invariants/properties specified would not broken. This may turn out to be one of the more practical approaches for using formal methods in Smart Contract design, but only time will tell.
